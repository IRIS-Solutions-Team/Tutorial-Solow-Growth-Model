Number of blocks: 5

Total number of equations: 8



## Block 1  

Number of equations: 1

Solve for 
* level of { }
* change in {`a`}


    ((a)/(a{-1}))=ss_roc_a;


## Block 2  

Number of equations: 1

Solve for 
* level of { }
* change in {`n`}


    ((n)/(n{-1}))=ss_roc_n;


## Block 3  

Number of equations: 4

Solve for 
* level of {`c`, `i`, `k`, `y`}
* change in {`c`, `i`, `k`, `y`}


    c=(1-sigma*exp(shk_c))*y;
    k=(1-delta)*k{-1}+i;
    y=(a*n)^gamma*k^(1-gamma);
    y=c+i;


## Block 4  

Number of equations: 1

Assign
* level of {`k_to_y`}
* change in {`k_to_y`}


    k_to_y=k/y;


## Block 5  

Number of equations: 1

Assign
* level of {`yy`}
* change in {`yy`}


    yy=log(y);
