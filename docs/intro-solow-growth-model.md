* Producers

* Sources of growth

## Consumers

Ã‡urrent income $Y_t$ allocated between consumption and investment

$$
Y_t = C_t + I_t
$$

<br/>

Consumption is a constant fraction of current income

$$
C_t = (1 - \sigma) Y_t
$$


<br/>

Investment and capital accumulation process

$$
\begin{gathered}
I_t = \sigma \, Y_t \\[5pt]
K_t = (1-\delta) \, K_{t-1} + I_t
\end{gathered}
$$

where 

* $\sigma$ is a saving rate

* $\delta$ is a depreciation rate

## Producers

Cobb-Douglas production technology

$$
Y_t = \left(A_t \, N_t\right)^\gamma \, K_t{}^{1-\gamma}
$$


---

## Sources of growth

Productivity (growth along intensive margins)

$$
A_t = a \, A_{t-1} \, \exp \epsilon_{A,t}
$$

<br/>

Employment (growth along extensive margins)

$$
N_t = n \, N_{t-1} \, \exp \epsilon_{N,t}
$$

<br/>

where

* $a$ is the long-run rate of change in productivity

* $n$ is the long-run rate of change in employment
